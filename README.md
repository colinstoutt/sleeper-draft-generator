## About The Project
The Sleeper Draft Generator was designed to assist fantasy football players in generating a random draft order for their league's draft. Additionally, it provides an order for a dynasty league's rookie draft by utilizing a lottery system. By storing a user's league ID in local storage and leveraging Sleeper's free API, this app can incorporate user data from their fantasy football league, resulting in a more personalized draft experience.
